Test project to use Android Studio. The name `PressyButton` has no reflection on what the app does, which is to calculate the percentage of a number.
It contains a simple `ConstraintLayout` with 2 numeric text fields, one the percentage, the other the number to get percentage of. Also has a field for the result and a button to calculate.
Simples.
